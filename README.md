The official [OMG! Chrome!](http://www.omgchrome.com) and [OMG! Ubuntu!](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk) Chrome and Opera extensions.

## Availability
The extension is available in the Chrome Web Store or can be downloaded from this repo and used as an unpacked extension.

## Usage
Please run `npm install -g gulp` (as sudo if necessary) to install the necessary prerequisite, then run `npm install` to install the extension's local dependencies.

To generate a production build, just run `gulp build` and a production directory, `dist`, will be built and ready for use!

## Development
Running `gulp dev` will watch for file changes and rebuild the extension on the fly.

To run the test suite run `gulp test` from the main repository.
